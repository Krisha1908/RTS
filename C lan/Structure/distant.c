/*3. Write a program to add two distances in inch-feet using structure. The values of the distances is to be taken from the user.

4. Enter the marks of 5 students in Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics (each out of 100) using a structure named Marks having elements roll no., name, chem_marks, maths_marks and phy_marks and then display the percentage of each student in a tabular form.
eg:
RollNo  Chem    Maths   Phy     Percentage
1       75      85      50      70

5. Write a structure to store the roll no., age (between 11 to 14) and marks of students. Store the information in structure.
1 - Print the roll numbers of all the students having age 14.
2 - Also print the marks of all the students having even roll no.

6. Write a structure to store the name, account number and balance of customers (more than 10) and store their information.
1 - Print the account number of all the customers having balance less than $200.
2 - Add interest amount of $100 in the balance of all the customers having more than $1000 in their balance and then print the incremented value of their balance.

7. Write a program to compare two dates entered by user. Make a structure named Date to store the elements day, month and year (all integers) to store the dates. If the dates are equal, display "Dates are equal" otherwise display "Dates are not equal".

8. Write a program to add, subtract, multiply and divide two complex numbers using structures to functions according to choice of the user.
Test Cases:
(6 + 4i) + (8 - 2i) = 14 + 2i
(10 + 3i) - (7 - 4i) = 3 + 7i
(2 + 3i) * (1 + 5i) = -13 + 13i
(3 + 4i) / (8 - 2i) = 0.235 + 0.559i
